# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the bulma-turbo-themes project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Why Use ADRs?

1. **Historical Context** - Understand why decisions were made
2. **Knowledge Transfer** - Onboard new team members faster
3. **Prevent Revisiting** - Avoid rehashing old discussions
4. **Transparency** - Make decision-making process visible
5. **Learning** - Reflect on past decisions and their outcomes

## ADR Format

We use a simplified ADR format with the following sections:

1. **Title** - Short noun phrase
2. **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context** - What is the issue we're addressing?
4. **Decision** - What decision did we make?
5. **Consequences** - What are the trade-offs and impacts?

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially:

```
0001-use-allstar-security.md
0002-sbom-signing-strategy.md
0003-reusable-workflows.md
```

Format: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`

## Workflow

### Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to a new file
2. Increment the number from the last ADR
3. Fill in the sections
4. Open a pull request
5. Discuss and refine
6. Merge when consensus is reached

### Superseding an ADR

When a decision is no longer valid:

1. Create a new ADR with the updated decision
2. Update the old ADR:
   - Change status to "Superseded by ADR-NNNN"
   - Add link to new ADR
3. Keep the old ADR for historical reference

### Example

```markdown
# Status

~~Accepted~~ Superseded by [ADR-0005](0005-new-decision.md)

## Superseded

This decision was superseded on 2025-11-01 by [ADR-0005](0005-new-decision.md) because...
```
