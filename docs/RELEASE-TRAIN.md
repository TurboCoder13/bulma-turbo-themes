# Release Train Documentation

This document describes the complete release train process for bulma-turbo-themes, ensuring consistent and automated releases.

## 🚂 Release Train Flow

The release train now follows a two-stage PR-based process:

1. **Semantic PR Title** → 2. **Commit Message** → 3. **Version PR** → 4. **Publish PR** → 5. **Release**

### 1-2. Semantic PR Title & Commit Message Validation

**Workflows:** `quality-semantic-pr-title.yml`, `quality-ci-main.yml`

**Purpose:** Ensures PR titles follow Conventional Commits format

**Allowed Types:**

- `chore` - Maintenance tasks
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `docs` - Documentation updates
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `revert` - Revert previous changes
- `style` - Code style changes
- `test` - Test updates

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

**Examples:**

- ✅ `feat: add dark mode theme`
- ✅ `fix(auth): resolve login issue`
- ✅ `docs: update installation guide`
- ❌ `Add new feature` (missing type)
- ❌ `feat add dark mode` (missing colon)

**Validation Process:**

1. Extracts commit messages between base branch and PR head
2. Validates each commit against Conventional Commits pattern
3. Ensures consistency with PR title validation rules
4. Reports validation results in CI logs

**Script:** `scripts/ci/validate-commit-messages.sh`

### 3. Version PR Creation

**Workflow:** `release-version-pr.yml`
**Trigger:** Push to `main` branch OR manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

**Purpose:** Creates a version bump PR for review before tag creation

**Process:**

1. **Quality Gate** - Runs linting, formatting, and tests
2. **Build** - Compiles TypeScript and builds Jekyll site
3. **PR Creation** - Creates a PR with:
   - Updated `package.json` version
   - Updated `package-lock.json`
   - Generated/updated `CHANGELOG.md`

**Requirements:**

- PR requires manual approval before merge
- Conventional commit rules apply (same as step 2)

**Example Workflow:**

```
main branch push
     ↓
Analyze commits for version bump
     ↓
Create version PR (e.g., v0.3.0)
     ↓
Review & Approve
     ↓
Merge version PR → creates git tag v0.3.0
```

**Configuration:** `.releaserc.json` (used in dry-run mode only)

### 4. Publish PR & Publishing

**Workflows:** `release-publish-pr.yml`
**Trigger:** Tag push (`v*.*.*`) OR manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

**Purpose:** Publishes package to npm and creates GitHub release

**Process:**

1. **Quality Gate** - Runs linting, formatting, and tests
2. **Build** - Compiles TypeScript and builds Jekyll site
3. **SBOM Generation** - Creates and signs Software Bill of Materials
4. **npm Publish** - Publishes to npm registry with provenance
5. **GitHub Release** - Creates GitHub release with SBOM artifacts

**Requirements:**

- `NPM_TOKEN` secret must be valid
- npm account must have publish permissions for `@turbocoder13/bulma-turbo-themes`
- 2FA must be set to "Authorization only" level

### 5. Manual Override: Automatic Tag Creation

**Workflow:** `release-auto-tag.yml` (Manual only)
**Trigger:** workflow_dispatch

**Purpose:** Emergency mechanism for manual tag creation if automation fails

**Inputs:**

- `version` - Version to tag (e.g., v1.2.3)
- `prerelease` - Mark as pre-release

**Use case:** Only use if release-version-pr workflow fails

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `.github/workflows/quality-semantic-pr-title.yml`

PR title validation using `TurboCoder13/py-lintro` action

### `.github/workflows/quality-ci-main.yml`

Main CI pipeline with commit validation and release trigger verification

### `.github/workflows/release-version-pr.yml`

Creates the version bump PR after `main` changes pass the quality and build gates.

### `.github/workflows/release-auto-tag.yml`

Creates a git tag (for example, `v0.4.0`) from the approved version PR when `package.json` changes are merged to `main`.

### `.github/workflows/release-publish-pr.yml`

Tag-triggered publish workflow that re-runs quality and build checks, generates SBOMs, publishes to npm, and creates the GitHub release.

### `.github/workflows/publish-npm-test.yml`

Manual publish workflow for pushing test/beta builds to npm under a non-`latest` dist-tag (for example, `beta`).

## 📋 Release Types

### Major Release (`v2.0.0`)

Triggered by:

- `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit message
- `feat!:` with breaking change description

### Minor Release (`v1.2.0`)

Triggered by:

- `feat:` commits

### Patch Release (`v1.1.1`)

Triggered by:

- `fix:` commits
- `perf:` commits
- `refactor:` commits
- `revert:` commits
- `build:` commits

### No Release

These commit types do not trigger releases:

- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `test:` - Test updates
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## 🚨 Validation Failures

### PR Title Validation Failure

- PR cannot be merged
- Comment posted explaining the issue
- Must fix title to continue

### Commit Message Validation Failure

- CI pipeline fails
- Must fix commit messages
- Use `git rebase -i` to amend commit messages

### Release Trigger Verification

- Informational only
- Shows whether commits will trigger a release
- Does not block PR merging

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Commit Messages Don't Match PR Title

1. Ensure commit messages follow same format as PR title
2. Use `git rebase -i` to amend commit messages
3. Force push to update PR

### Release Not Triggered

1. Check commit types against release rules
2. Ensure commits are on `main` branch
3. Verify the version PR and auto-tag workflows ran successfully:
   - `release-version-pr.yml` created a version PR
   - `release-auto-tag.yml` created a `v*.*.*` tag after the version PR was merged

### Tag Created But No Release

1. Check `release-publish-pr.yml` workflow (for tagged releases) or `publish-npm-test.yml` (for manual test publishes)
2. Verify npm token permissions and that `NPM_TOKEN` is configured in repository secrets
3. Check that the GitHub release job completed and attached SBOM artifacts correctly

## 📚 Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Use Conventional Commits** - Follow the format strictly
2. **Match PR Title to Commits** - Ensure consistency
3. **Test Locally** - Run `npm run ci:quick` before pushing
4. **Review Release Impact** - Understand what your changes will trigger
5. **Run E2E Tests When Touching UI/Theme Logic** - Use `npm run e2e:ci` (no retries by default) to catch flakes locally instead of relying on CI.

### For Maintainers

1. **Monitor Release Workflows** - Ensure they run successfully
2. **Review SBOM Signatures** - Verify security artifacts
3. **Check npm Publishing** - Verify package availability
4. **Update Documentation** - Keep this guide current
5. **Watch for E2E Failures** - Playwright runs in CI with retries disabled; any failure (including flaky tests) will fail the workflow and should be investigated before releasing.
