# Governance

- Decision making: Maintainers use consensus; for contentious changes, majority vote.
- Releases: Follow `RELEASE.md` (SemVer). Release owners are listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`.
- Security: Follow `SECURITY.md`; embargo until fix is released.
- Changes: Significant changes require an RFC issue with design, risks, and rollout.
- Ownership: Changes to governance require a PR and maintainer approval.
