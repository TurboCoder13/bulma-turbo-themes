# Shellcheck configuration
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive
#
# NOTE: These suppressions are global because they apply consistently across
# the codebase's shell scripting patterns. Using inline suppressions would
# require adding them to 50+ locations. If a specific script doesn't follow
# these patterns, add inline `# shellcheck enable=SCXXXX` to re-enable.

# SC1091: Not following sourced file
# Reason: Scripts source ../utils/utils.sh which exists at runtime but
# shellcheck can't follow relative paths from arbitrary contexts
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Reason: Variables may be used in sourced scripts or exported for subshells
disable=SC2034

# SC2329: Function is never invoked
# Reason: Functions may be utility/library functions sourced by other scripts
disable=SC2329

# SC2129: Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file
# Reason: Style preference, individual redirects are also correct
disable=SC2129

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes
# Reason: Often intentional to pass literal strings (e.g., to awk/sed)
disable=SC2016

# SC2012: Use find instead of ls
# Reason: Style preference, ls is fine for simple directory listings
disable=SC2012

# SC2148: Tips depend on target shell and yours is unknown
# Reason: Some generated files (e.g., husky) don't have shebangs by design
disable=SC2148
