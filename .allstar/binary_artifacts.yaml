# Binary Artifacts Policy
# Prevents binary artifacts from being committed to the repository
# See: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#binary-artifacts

optConfig:
  # Enable this policy on all repositories
  optOutStrategy: true
  # Disable repository override to enforce consistently
  disableRepoOverride: true

# Action to take when policy is violated: create/update an issue
action: issue
# Note: This policy uses OpenSSF Scorecard's Binary Artifacts check
# Binary files should not be committed to the repository for security reasons
# Exceptions can be configured if needed by adding opt-out repos
